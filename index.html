                Android is an operating system which is built basically for Mobile phones. It is based on the Linux
                Kernel and other open-source software and is developed by Google. The android app is developed on an
                application known as Android Studio. These executable apps are installed through a bundle or package
                called APK(Android Package Kit).
            </p>

            <p>
                Git is an open-source version control system. It means that whenever a developer develops some project
                (like an app) or something, he/she constantly update it catering to the demands of users, technology,
                and whatsoever it maybe. Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the
                modifications in a central repository. It allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download
                a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see
                these new changes, download them, and contribute. Git is used to storing the source code for a project
                and track the complete history of all changes to that code, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform built
                around the Git tool. So it’s necessary to upload your android project on GitHub.
